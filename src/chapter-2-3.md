Identifying personal obstacles is a crucial step in overcoming them. Here are some common challenges you may encounter:

1. **Fear of Failure:** The fear of failure can prevent you from taking risks and pursuing challenging goals. It can undermine your confidence and hold you back from fully embracing your purpose.

2. **Lack of Clarity:** Uncertainty about your purpose or lack of clarity can make it difficult to set meaningful goals. Without a clear direction, you may struggle to prioritize and take focused action.
